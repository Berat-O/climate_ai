## Project Description

In this project, we aim to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to climate data for various applications, such as climate prediction, data analysis, and environmental modeling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following software and tools installed:

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/climate-ai.git

2. Create a new Anaconda virtual environment and activate it:
    ```shell
    conda create --name myenv
    conda activate myenv

3. Install the xesmf package from the conda-forge channel
    ```shell
    conda install -c conda-forge xesmf
    

4. Install the climate-learn package using pip
    ```shell
    pip install climate-learn

With these steps, you should have a clean virtual environment set up for your climate AI project, and the required packages should be installed and ready for use.
